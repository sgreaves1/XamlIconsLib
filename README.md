# XamlIconsLib
A Library of xaml geometry icons with a sample project

I DID NOT MAKE THESE ICONS MYSELF.

This is the source code for the xaml icons library (also contains a sample project to see all icons).
please feel free to contribute.

library is available as a nuget package. https://www.nuget.org/packages/XamlIcons/
To use simply add:
xmlns:xamlIconLibrary="clr-namespace:XamlIconLibrary;assembly=XamlIconLibrary"
inside the xaml window tags

Each icon is taken from a free set of icons online and organised into catagories based on the name of the source
example:
<xamlIconLibrary:GoogleMaterialIcon Icon="Assignment"/>

Icon is the name of the icon. use intelisense to see a list of the availible icons made by that source.
